# Reporting bugs and feature requests

We have multiple options for reporting bugs and asking for feature requests.

- The easiest way to report bugs is to long-press a game in the menu and choose "Report A Bug" which will prefill an email with helpful information for us to help fix your bug. Feel free to use this to request features as well.
- Join our Discord channel located at:

Looking forward hearing from you!
