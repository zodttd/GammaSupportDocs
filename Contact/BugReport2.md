# Reporting bugs and feature requests

We have multiple options for reporting bugs and asking for feature requests.

- The easiest way to report bugs is to long-press a game in the menu and choose "Report A Bug" which will prefill an email with helpful information for us to help fix your bug. Feel free to use this to request features as well.
- Join our Discord channel located at:
[https://discord.gg/hG8Xtze7](https://discord.gg/hG8Xtze7)
- Our feedback form at GitHub. It requires a quick free sign up and lets us quickly get to work on it. It's located at:
[https://github.com/zodttd/GammaSupportDocs/issues](https://github.com/zodttd/GammaSupportDocs/issues)
- You can always email us at:
[gamma@zodttd.com](mailto:gamma@zodttd.com)

Looking forward hearing from you!
