# Reporting bugs and feature requests

We have two options for reporting bugs and asking for feature requests.

1. You can always email us at:
[gamma@zodttd.com](mailto:gamma@zodttd.com)
2. Our feedback form at GitHub. It requires a quick free sign up and lets us quickly get to work on it. It's located at:
[https://github.com/zodttd/GammaSupportDocs/issues](https://github.com/zodttd/GammaSupportDocs/issues)

Looking forward hearing from you!
