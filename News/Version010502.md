# Version 1.5.2 is here!


The following games are now compatible:
- Super Robot Wars Taisen Alpha 
- Super Robot Wars Taisen Gaiden
- Vagrant Story 
- Breath of Fire 4
- and more!

We added:
- Multi-code cheats are now working. Cheat codes will be enabled for all users once testing is complete.
- Added a Widescreen 3D option to modify 3D games to work in landscape 16:9 wide format.
- Added a Precise Cycle option to increase compatibility. If your game doesn't work, try enabling this.
- Initial support for deep links is being tested.
- Added some Widescreen Gameshark-format cheat codes. They work well without any options. Works well on Crash Bandicoot!
- We have easy disc swapping, PGXP type of high resolution 3D, sync and hardware controllers are working, 

Lots more in the works too! Thank you so much for your support! Big shout out to the Gamma Pros and Supporters out there who have been making it possible for me to work on this!
