# Cheat codes are here!

Gamma Pro users are currently able to try this feature out early!
Enabling cheats is easy:
 - Go to the pause menu inside the game, choose Cheats
 - Search for codes by selecting the add "+" icon
 - Cheats enabled with a checkmark will be activated when resuming the game

In v1.5.2 we added some Gameshark-format cheat codes that force an accurate widescreen in landscape for games like Crash Bandicoot! Let us know if we missed any codes!

We're always listening to our fans and glad to bring you this top request. Thank you for all the feedback!
