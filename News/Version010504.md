# Version 1.5.4 is here!


Gamma has been updated to version 1.5.4 with the following:
 - Fixed portrait view's aspect ratio from being stretched by fullscreen settings
 - Added harware controller mappings for L3, R3, Xbox Paddle, and Dual Shock touch pad
 - Fixed a popup for Gamma Pro when using deep links
 - Bug report feature added to the long-press menu for each game
 - New settings for Full Screen Mode to handle landscape orientation's widescreen
 - - Set to OFF, GAME, or ON.
 - - - On forces full screen
 - - - GAME sets fullscreen if a scene supports it
 - - - OFF has no stretching of the screen
 - - - Default is now GAME

Widescreen on Gamma looks great, give it a try! You can always disable it at any time.
Remember to try the new "Precise Cycles" option for any game that isn't working, and let us know if it helps.
We're always listening to our fans and glad to bring you your requests. Thank you for all the feedback!
