# Multi-Disc games are now supported

Some games come on multiple CDs. When completing one CD, the game will ask to insert a new CD. This is called a disc swap.

Swapping Discs is easy:

If you use multi-disc PBP format, just tap the Swap Disc icon in the pause menu and it will cycle through the discs.

If you use any other format:
Gamma allows you to longpress a title and choose Set To Swap Disc. This CD gets used for the Swap Disc feature in the pause menu. 
 - Go to the pause menu inside the game, choose Main Menu
 - Tap and hold the game's disc imported, choose Set To Swap Disc
 - Go back to the game that was originally paused and choose Resume
 - Go to the pause menu and choose Swap Disc, and the new CD will be used
