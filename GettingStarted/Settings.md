# Descriptions of Gamma's Settings

We've added a lot of settings so we'll start to describe them here.

The crown icon is for signing up for Gamma Pro to go ad-free.
The question mark icon is for Gamma Support Center.
The plus sign icon is for importing games.

Gamma's main settings are accessed with the gear icon in the upper left.
In Emulation Settings -> Gamma there are settings for the core. Right now we have:
- Upgraded Hi-Res Graphics: This enables increased resolution of 3D games similar to PGXP.
- Precise Cycles: This more accurately emulates processor cycles. If your game isn't working, try enabling this first.
- Format Memory Cards: Use this feature to format your memory card files, erasing all data. If your memory cards get corrupted somehow, this will fix it.
- BIOS: Set an optional BIOS file

Controller Type lets you set whether you want Touch Screen or Hardware Controller controls.

Controller Skins lets you select new skins, which can be downloaded from Gamma Support Center.

Controller Skin Transparency makes skins that are see-through such as the default landscape skin, able to be more or less see-through.

Stay Silent lets Gamma respect the setting of the iOS device. If your iOS device is muted and this option is enabled, Gamma won't play sound.

Full Screen - Landscape is an option that stretches the landscape screen to the entire device's area.
Wide Screen 3D - When combined with Full Screen option, Widescreen tricks 3D games into rendering nicer looking on widescreens.

Vibration settings for buttons and directional pads let you determine if you want haptic vitrative feedback on those touch controls.

Sync Service lets you choose Google Drive or Dropbox to sync your library and saves to the cloud. You sign in your cloud service, and Gamma takes care of everything for you. Check this section if there's any conflicts, such as when Gamma isn't sure to use the file on the phone or a version of the file in the cloud. Google Drive is the preferred sync service between the two.

Game Previews setting lets you disable the long-press previews seen in the main menu.
