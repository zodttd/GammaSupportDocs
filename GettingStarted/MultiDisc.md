# How to swap CDs

Some games come on multiple CDs. When completing one CD, the game will ask to insert a new CD. This is called a disc swap.

To Swap A Disc During A Game:
- If you use multi-disc PBP format, just tap the Swap Disc icon in the pause menu and it will cycle through the discs.
- If you use any other format:
Gamma allows you to longpress a title and choose Set To Swap Disc. This CD gets used for the Swap Disc feature in the pause menu. 
 - - Go to the pause menu inside the game, choose Main Menu
 - - Tap and hold the game's disc imported, choose Set To Swap Disc
 - - Go back to the game that was originally paused and choose Resume
 - - Go to the pause menu and choose Swap Disc, and the new CD will be used

After disc swapping, you will typically resume later games by loading the new disc from Gamma's main menu. You will most likely want to transfer your in-game memory card saves from the previous disc over to the new one. This is done by:
 - Long-press the game's disc you want to transfer memory card saves from
 - Choose "Export Memory Card" and save the file to a temporary location 
 - Long-press the current game's disc and choose "Import Memory Card"
 - Select the memory card file you just exported and it will now have all the previous disc's in-game saves
