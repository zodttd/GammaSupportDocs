# Supported File Types

Gamma supports the following file types:

- BIN
Also known as Mode 2352
- CUE/BIN
When importing multidisc BIN files, a CUE file is used. You must import the CUE at the same time as all the BIN files in order for them to be grouped and imported correctly into a single title.
- CHD
- PBP (Supports discswapping as of version 1.5.0)
- MDS
- ISO
