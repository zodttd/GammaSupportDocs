# Advanced Features

Gamma has some features for users wanting to experiment with some options. They are located in Settings -> Gamma Core.

Currently documented features:
 - Precise Cycles: This feature is disabled by default. It can improve compatibility with specific games. It's used as a way to debug problematic games. It can also cause glitches in other games so it's typically left Off by default.
 - Upgraded Hi-Res Graphics: This will increase the resolution of 3D graphics but may cause glitches in some games. It's On by default. If you notice graphical issues, try disabling this feature.
 - Enhanced Audio: This is On by default and will add interpolation and other sound effects at a slight performance hit.
 - Widescreen 3D: This is a highly experimental feature that tricks the 3D engine of the game to show a wider screen. It often breaks games due to positioning items on the screen in the wrong locations.

 If you notice these features help make a game compatible, use Report a Bug by long-pressing the game in the main menu and let us know!
